Having installed the program you receive two ways of using it either as CLI python script or web application.

## CLI python script.

The script can be run from the terminal by invoking it with the following command `python3 meme.py` either with arguments or without them. Be defaulf with no arguments whatsoever the script will generate you a random meme from the data you download from the github - picture, author and quote.  If you pass three arguments `-a` author - author of the quote, `-q` quote itself and `-p` path for the image you want to use for your own meme.

### Web application

In order to do that one has to provide a link to the image on the internet and fill other two mandatory fields author and body of the quote.
